Description: Implements indirect demographic methods for estimating adult mortality from
    orphanhood data. The package includes the standard Brass (1973) method, the
    regression-based approach developed by Timaeus (1991), and the adjustments
    proposed by Luy (2012) for low-mortality populations
    <doi:10.1007/s13524-012-0101-7>.
    A relational model is used to harmonize estimates into comparable adult
    mortality indicators. The package also provides diagnostic tools to assess
    the sensitivity of results to assumptions about the mean age of childbearing
    and the choice of model life table family.
